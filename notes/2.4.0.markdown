This minor release tracks Jackson 2.4. It is the first version of the
module to support Scala 2.11, and drops support for Scala 2.9. Support
for Scala 2.9 remains in the 2.3.x series, which will receive critical
bugfixes for the forseeable future, but new features will only be
applied to 2.4.0 and beyond.

Release 2.4 also fixes a number of issues.
